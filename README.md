# Usability benchmarks for graph libraries

This repository contains a set of simple tasks to gauge not the performance, but the usability of network analysis libraries.

These exercises will be solved using various graph libraries in various programming languages (including all three high-level interfaces of igraph). We will use this comparison to improve igraph's high-level APIs and make sure that they stand out in usability.

We welcome the developers of other network analysis libraries to join the project, and use the information here to improve their software. Contributions of new benchmark tasks, as well as solutions to the existing tasks are very welcome.
